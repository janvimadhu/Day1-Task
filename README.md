# Day1-Task

STEP 1: Build the Docker IMAGE 

Use the command , docker build -option <name-of-the-image> <path-to-the-dockerfile-directory>
  
For example : USE
  docker build -t day1task .
  Here docker build is the basic command to build the docker image 
 #-t option flag tags our image 
 #day1task is the name of the image which we have to refer when we run the container
 #. at the end of the docker build command basically informs that the dockerfile should look for the dockerfile in the current directory. 


STEP 2: RUN THE DOCKER IMAGE TO START THE CONTAINER
